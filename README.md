## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

With this project I had the chance to apply my knowledge and create a blog page using only CSS, HTML and Javascript, which I hadn't made in a while.


### Continued development

The topics which I think I cana improve is how to deal with background images and position relative, where and how to apply them more efficiently.
